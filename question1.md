- **Data Rate:**
  Transmission rate, also known as data rate, is the number of bits transmitted during
  a period of time divided by that time and is measured in bits per second (bps).

- **Channel Capacity:**
  The maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a
  communication channel under given conditions is referred as the channel capacity.
  
- **Bandwidth Of Channel:**
  Bandwidth merely specifies a range of frequencies, from the lowest to
  the highest, that the channel can carry or that are present in the signal. It
  is one way of describing the maximum amount of information that the
  channel can carry. Bandwidth is expressed differently for analog and
  digital circuits. In analog technology, the bandwidth of a circuit is the
  difference between the lowest and highest frequencies that can pass
  through the channel. Engineers measure analog bandwidth in kilohertz or megahertz.

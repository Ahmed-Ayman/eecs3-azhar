# Question 9

#### what is the difference between (Data link layer, Network layer, Transport layer) from the point of sending a message from source to destination nodes and  their functions ?

#### Data link layer

>The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.

#### Network layer
>The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called datagrams) from one node to another connected in "different networks".

#### Transport layer
>The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks, while maintaining the quality of service functions.

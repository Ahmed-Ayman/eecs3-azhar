# Answer

1. **Application Layer** :
>serves the user and performs all kind of requests such as sharing files, printing files,e-mails, it uses Protocol Data Unit (PDU) to  build a form for a message from the source to the destination.

 PDU format:


 |  ID of S | Date (dd/mm/yy) |
 |----------|-----------------|

>2. **Presentation Layer**
this layer allows us to see the recieved data in the correct format , like the letters,pictures,videos just like the way the sent.
also..
This layer defines how data in the native format of remote host should be presented in the native format of host.

>3. **Session Layer**
This layer maintains sessions between remote hosts. For example, once user/password authentication is done, the remote host maintains this session for a while and does not ask for authentication again in that time span.

>4. **Transport Layer**
 This layer is responsible for end-to-end delivery between hosts.

 >5. **Network Layer**
 This layer is responsible for address assignment and uniquely addressing hosts in a network.

 >6. **Data link Layer**
 This layer is concerned with Transmitting the data from the source to the the destination nodes.its responsible for handling the reading and the writing of the data and the Link errors are detected at this layer.

 >6. **Physical Layer**
 This layer defines the hardware, cabling wiring, power output, pulse rate etc.
